# Stochastic-simulation-of-transcription

This R function simulates the bacterial RNA transcription and decay. It is predominantly designed to generate time series data after a stop of the transcription initiation, which resembles the effect of the antibiotic Rifampicin. Experimental Rifampicin time series data are widely used to study the RNA stability. 
Various aspects of transcription can be specified.
